Every day may not be good, but there's something good in every day.
You're braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.
Keep your face always toward the sunshine, and shadows will fall behind you.
It's not whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get up.
The only time you fail is when you fall down and stay down.
