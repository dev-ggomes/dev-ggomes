Every day may not be good, but there's something good in every day.
You're braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.
Keep your face always toward the sunshine, and shadows will fall behind you.
It's not whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get up.
The only time you fail is when you fall down and stay down.

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
Every bird that flies has overcome the fear of falling.
Persist until it becomes easy.
Don’t stop when you’re tired. Stop when you’re done.
Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.
Don't limit your challenges, challenge your limits.
Happiness is not by chance, but by choice.
Change your thoughts and you change your world.
To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong.
All progress takes place outside the comfort zone.
